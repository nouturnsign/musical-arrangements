## Usage

The repository is organized in two main parts. `source` is for internal use and contains submodules to the original source
files. [`export`](/export) contains the exported files. Other files include `README.md` (this file you are reading),
`LICENSE.txt` (license text), `helper.sh` (script for internal use), and `.gitignore` and `.gitmodules` (git files for
internal use).

Each project has a unique identifier, that being the name of the original source repository. In the export folder, for
each identifier, there are version numbers. Within each of those version numbers are the relevant exported files.

For example, `first-rate-town` version 0.2.2 is located at
[`/export/first-rate-town/v0.2.2`](/export/first-rate-town/v0.2.2). A full listing is given below.
